**6.2.** CRYTEK INDEMNIFICATION DISCLAIMER.

### A. In case that German law applies:

**6.2.1.** Crytek is liable for damages, regardless on which legal basis (be it contract, tort or otherwise) only if (a) such damages are cause by violation of essential obligations of this Agreement (Kardinalpflichten) for Crytek's negligence or intent (Verschulden) which endangers the purpose of the Agreement; or (b) such damages are caused by Crytek's gross negligence or intent.

**6.2.2.** In case that Crytek is liable for the violation of an essential obligation of this Agreement (Kardinalpflicht) without acting with gross negligence or intent then the liability is limited to amount of payments received from the respective Licensee.

**6.2.3.** If Crytek is liable for damages pursuant to Section (a) above for gross negligence or intent of Crytek staff other than the managing directors then the liability is also limited to the amount set forth in Section (b).

**6.2.4.** Crytek is not liable for indirect or consequential damages (Mangelfolgeschäden), loss of profits or frustrated costs if such damages are not a result of gross negligence or intent of Crytek's managing directors.

**6.2.5.** The exclusion or limitation of liability pursuant to this Sec. 5 also applies with respect to claims against Crytek's staff or contractors.

**6.2.6.** The liability of Crytek with respect to death, bodily injury or health, a guarantee by Crytek (if any) or pursuant to the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz) shall remain unaffected.

**6.2.7.** If the Licensee is also liable for certain damages then Crytek shall bear an amount of such damages in accordance to its contributory negligence (Mitverschulden). With respect to the User's responsibility for reduction of damages (Schadensminderungsobligenheit) the Licensee is responsible for regular back-ups of its data and in case of an assumed bug shall take all further reasonable measures.

CRYTEK'S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY MANNER RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) WILL BE LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY OR ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE TO CRYTEK UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. THE FOREGOING ALLOCATION OF RISK IS REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

**6.3.** Licensee Indemnification: Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Crytek against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) and all other liability related to any claim on Licensee's use of the CRYENGINE.

## 7. Feedback

The provisions of this Agreement which by their terms or sense are intended to survive shall survive cancellation, expiration or termination of this Agreement.

## 9. General Provisions
**9.1.** Oral agreements have not been made. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements made between the Parties regarding CRYENGINE.

For avoidance of doubt: this Agreement cannot be combined with agreements regarding CRYENGINE entered into in the past.

**9.2.** This Agreement does not constitute and shall not be construed as constituting a partnership or joint venture between Crytek and Licensee. Neither party hereto shall have any right to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever, and nothing herein contained shall give, or is intended to give, any rights of any kind to any third persons.

**9.3.** If any provision of this Agreement shall be found to be invalid or unenforceable for legal or factual reasons the invalidity or unenforceability of such provisions shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement and all provisions of this Agreement not affected by such invalidity or unenforceability shall remain in full force and effect. The parties hereby agree to attempt to substitute for any invalid or unenforceable provision a valid or enforceable provision which achieves to the greatest extent possible the economic and legal objective of the Agreement. This applies as well in case of an omission or invalidity of the whole Agreement.

**9.4.** This Agreement shall be governed and construed by the laws of Germany. Place of performance of this Agreement is Frankfurt a.M. (Germany).
